# Clae

A clean, simple, responsive HTML 5 Theme for [Ghost](http://ghost.org).

### WARNING: Clae is now unsupported. Use at your own risk.

See the README.html for installation and configuration details if you need them.

Clae (pronounced "Clay") will automatically use the Cover and Logo you upload in your Ghost settings. For best results, use a darker, wide, panorama like cover, and a light, if not white logo with a transparent background. Note that the logo will be scaled to match the header text, but the background will be trimmed to cover the area, usually losing the left and right of the image, as it is centered vertically. This will vary according to screen size, and as such your header image should be at least 1920x1080px, and a .jpg to save on file size. [JPEGMini](http://www.jpegmini.com) is a good site for unnoticeable compression.

The theme is both responsive and touch-ready, and incorporates the latest web technologies, and the most graceful of fallback options, providing a near seamless experience from Internet Explorer 7 through to the latest and greatest browsers.

We wish to express thanks to [Flat UI Colors](http://flatuicolors.com/) for their wonderful shades of blue, and [FlatIcons.net](http://flaticons.net/) for their royalty free [up arrow](http://flaticons.net/customize.php?dir=Application&icon=Arrowhead-Up.png). It is, almost always, the little things.

Please note that neither the cover nor the logo are included in this package, and that the theme name in the footer changes with the site title to match the header, and is not required credit nor attribution.
